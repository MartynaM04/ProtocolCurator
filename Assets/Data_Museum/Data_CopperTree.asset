  officialName: Copper Tree
  propagandaDescription: A tree look-a-like decoration made of poor quality copper.
    The residents of Segment 7, deprived of access to state art, have begun to worship
    objects made from garbage, which demonstrates their civilizational regression.
  trueName: Copper Tree
  hiddenTruthDescription: The tree's branches aren't arranged randomly. They create
    a precise map of Segment 7's underground channels. This is how the Rebels hid
    their evacuation plans inside a seemingly worthless decoration.
