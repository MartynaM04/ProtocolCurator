  officialName: Hand of Tyrant
  propagandaDescription: Remains of a statue of the Rebel leader. The rebels, in
    their pride, erected statues of their leaders, wasting valuable resources in
    the process.
  trueName: Hand of Tyrant
  hiddenTruthDescription: The statue never depicted the leader of the Rebellion,
    but rather the "Mother of the Segment" holding a loaf of bread. It was a symbol
    of peace and prosperity that the New People ordered to destroy to erase the memory
    of weal.
