  propagandaDescription: Evidence of cultural depravity. Lack of access to approved
    educational toys meant that children in Segment 7 grew up surrounded by garbage,
    which shaped their rebellious natures.
  trueName: Old Doll
  hiddenTruthDescription: The doll was made of scraps from burned clothes. The residents
    of Segment 7 wanted to ensure that the children could have at least a shred of
    normalcy in a world where every second was a fight for survival.
